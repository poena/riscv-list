# Tools Chain

## r**iscv-gnu-toolchain**

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ git clone -recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv
$ make
```



{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
